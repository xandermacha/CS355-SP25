2.   Defragmenting a large hard drive can take a very long
     time.  To consolidate a DoubleSpace compressed drive,
     change to the compressed drive and then issue a command
     like so:
   
           dblspace /defragment <ENTER>
        
     A shortcut for the above command is:
        
           dblspace /def <ENTER>
